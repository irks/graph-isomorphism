Program to check if 2 graphs are isomorphic. <br />
Example graphs are provided. <br />
There is a number of edges in graph in the first row of file.<br />
The numbers in next rows are representing pairs of vertices (for every edge).<br />
To run the program, it is needed to give names of two files with data about graphs.<br />
